## 4. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of retail sales transaction data with the following columns:

- **Order_Date** – Date of the sales transaction  
- **Product** – Name of the product sold  
- **Category** – Product category

## 5. Data Preparation

Before analysis, the following preparation steps were performed:

- Converted raw data into an Excel Table
- Ensured numeric columns (Sales and Quantity) were correctly formatted
- Added a derived **Month** column from the Order_Date field to support monthly analysis
- Organized the workbook into separate sheets for Raw Data, Pivot Tables, and Dashboard

## 6. Pivot Table Analysis

Multiple pivot tables were created to analyze the data from different perspectives:

- **Total Sales** – Overall sales summary
- **Sales by Category** – Category-wise sales analysis
- **Sales by Region** – Regional sales comparison
- **Monthly Sales Trend** – Month-wise sales performance
- **Top 5 Products by Sales** – Identification of top-selling products

These pivot tables act as the backend for the dashboard visualizations.

## 7. Dashboard Creation

An interactive dashboard was created using charts derived from the pivot tables.  
The dashboard includes:

- KPI cards displaying **Total Sales** and **Total Quantity Sold**
- Column chart showing Sales by Category
- Bar chart comparing Sales by Region
- Line chart representing Monthly Sales Trend
- Chart highlighting Top 5 Products by Sales

The dashboard provides a clear and high-level view of retail performance for easy interpretation.
